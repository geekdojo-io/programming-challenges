# Question: https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/input-output/basics-of-input-output/practice-problems/algorithm/tds-and-his-breakup/

# Hint1: You can receive inputs for this question in the following way:
N = int(input())
X = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    Y = int(input())
    # Write a custom code here
    
    

































# My Solution:
N = int(input())
X = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    Y = int(input())
    print('YES' if X <= Y else 'NO')
