# Hint1. You can get the input integer 'T' on the first line
#       and string S1 and S2 in a line for each test using the following code:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    S1, S2 = input().split()
    # Your logic goes here
    
# Hint2. S1 and S2 are said to be identical if any of them are rearranged (purmutation).
#        So, they are anagrams. There are several techniques to find if two strings are anagrams.
#        Here is a resource -- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/
