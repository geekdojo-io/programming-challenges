# Hint 1. To get the line that contains a string, you can use the following code:
S = input()

# Hint 2. This problem has lots of special rules, making it a little difficult to use a for-loop. Also, the length of a string is always 9. 
# So, I'd just use a simple if-else logic, and print 'invalid' or 'valid' depending on a logic.
